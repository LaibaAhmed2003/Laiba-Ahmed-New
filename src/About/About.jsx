        <h2>Hi, I'm Laiba Ahmed.</h2>
        <p>
          Did you know that almost 85% of founders are unaware of their
          website's potential?
          <br />
          <br />
          I've analyzed over 230 websites and found common issues:
          <br />
          <br />
          Misaligned design and sections with their target audience.
          <br />
          Low page sessions due to vague website design.
          <br />
          Slow website speed causing visitors to leave without taking action.
          <br />
          Non-mobile-responsive websites leading to unfilled opt-in forms.
          <br />
          <br />
          These mistakes can drastically lower your business ROI. If you're
          facing any of these issues, it's time to revamp your website.
          <br />
          <br />

          rates:

          conversions and revenue. Remember, your website promotes you 24/7.
