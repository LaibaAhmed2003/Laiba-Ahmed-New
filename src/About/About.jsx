        <p>
          Did you know 85% of founders aren't fully aware of their website's
          potential?
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After analyzing over 230 websites, I've found common issues like
          misaligned design, low page sessions, slow speed, and non-mobile
          responsiveness. These mistakes can seriously hurt your ROI.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I've helped 100+ businesses improve conversions through custom
          designs, better usability, engaging landing pages, faster speeds, and
          mobile optimization. Remember, your website promotes you 24/7.
          <br></br>
